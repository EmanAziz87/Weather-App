# Weather-App

Weather Watch is a weather app that displays the weather of an inputted city. 
The apps purpose was to ground my understanding of APIs and how to work with them.
The project also utilizes a component based development approach with webpack, unlike my previous projects. The user inputted value is sent used in the Openweathermap API URL that fetches the appropriate weather JSON information. I then extracted the weather information I wanted to display from the JSON and used a separate JavaScript component to display those elements to the DOM.

Below is the project in action!
